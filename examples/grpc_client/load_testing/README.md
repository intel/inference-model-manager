# Load Test

## Prerequisites
* Python 3.6
* Install [requirements](../requirements.txt) needed to launch [grpc client](../README.md)
* Install Locust requirements ```pip install -r requirements-locust.txt```


## Description
Script available under this directory allows users to execute their own load tests. Prepared [Locust class](image_locust.py)
loads configuration from environment variables and images also creates grpc stub in `on start` method. In hatching phase this client only performs requests to GRPC service using earlier loaded images. 
The number of comma-delimited photo paths determines the size of the batch. Now this tests only support resnet model.

## Configurable parameters
````
    GRPC_ADDRESS # address to grpc endpoint
    MODEL_NAME = # model name; default value=resnet
    TENSOR_NAME # input tensor name; default value=in
    IMAGES # path to images, separated by comma; example=/test/image.jpeg,/test/image2.jpeg
    SERVER_CERT # path to server certificate
    CLIENT_CERT # path to client certificate
    CLIENT_KEY # path to client key
    TRANSPOSE # set to True if you want to transpose input or completly unset env to not transpose
    TIMEOUT # timeout used in grpc request; default value=10.0
````

## Start Locust

A script was prepared to launch specific amount of locust instances, by passing integer to bash script. 
Without passing any parameter script will launch Locust in distributed mode with 2 slaves.
If you want to perform as many RPS as possible we recommend to spawn 1 slave for 1 CPU core.
Also this script creates temporary file `pid_locust` which keeps PID of processes launched by this script.

```./start_locust.sh```

Examples:
```
   ./start_locust.sh 1 # Launch Locust in distributed mode with 1 slave
   ./start_locust.sh 0 # Launch Locust in single instance mode
   ./start_locust.sh 4 # Launch Locust in distributed mode with 4 slaves
```

After using this command Locust will be available under [http://localhost:8089](http://localhost:8089)

## Stop Locust

We run all instances as background process, so to stop load tests you can use our script ```./stop_locust```
, which also removes temporary file created earlier or read PIDs in `pid_locust` file and simply kill processes listed in that file.
